WARRANTY
We warrant that the physical media on which the Software is distributed, if applicable, will be free from defects, and that the Software shall conform substantially to the description in its Documentation for the first thirty (30) days following the date of Your purchase ("Warranty Period") when used in an environment that We support in accordance with the Software Specific Terms, unless otherwise required by applicable law. If the physical media on which the Software is distributed is defective, Your sole and exclusive remedy will be for Us to replace the defective media and You shall only be entitled to such remedy if You return such defective media to Us within the Warranty Period. If the Software contains defects, Your sole and exclusive remedy will be for Us, at our option and sole discretion, (a) to use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the defects in the Software or (b) to replace the defective Software. Defects in the Software mean that the Software does not substantially conform to the description in its Documentation. If We are unable to correct or replace the defective Software, You may discontinue Your use of the licensed Software and terminate Your license to the Software. The above remedies for defects in the media and/or Software are Our sole and entire liability under this EULA. Our limited warranty obligations under this section are subject to the following conditions: (a) the Software must have been properly installed and used in accordance with the instructions in its Documentation; (b) no modification, alteration, or addition has been made to the Software by persons other than Us or Our authorized representative(s); and (c) We receive (i) written notice of the non-conformity; or (ii) the defective physical media, as applicable, within the Warranty Period.  The OEM Licenses are optimized for the OEM device that they are Bundled with, and hence may not operate properly on other devices.

WHERE YOU OBTAIN SUCH SOFTWARE OR SUPPORT FREE OF CHARGE, YOU ARE DOING SO WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER AND YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE AND/OR SUPPORT WILL BE AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE SOFTWARE MAY CONTAIN "OPEN SOURCE" MATERIALS (E.G., ANY SOFTWARE SUBJECT TO OPEN SOURCE, COPYLEFT, GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, MOZILLA LICENSE, BERKELEY SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION LICENSE, OPENSOURCE INITIATIVE LICENSE, MIT, APACHE OR PUBLIC DOMAIN LICENSES, OR SIMILAR LICENSE) OR THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE (AS DEFINED BELOW). WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO OPEN-SOURCE MATERIALS OR THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE CONTAINED IN THE SOFTWARE. THE SOFTWARE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS, DELAYS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN THE USE OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS AND WE EXPRESSLY ARE NOT AND WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DELAYS, DELIVERY FAILURES, OR OTHER DAMAGE RESULTING FROM ANY SUCH PROBLEMS.

(<http://www.mpegla.com/main/default.aspx>), 6312 S. Fiddlers Green Circle, Suite 400E, Greenwood Village, Colorado, 80111, USA. You acknowledge that the Software may be licensed under the VC-1 patent portfolio license for the personal and non-commercial use of a consumer to (1) encode video in compliance with the VC-1 standard ("VC-1 video") and/or (2) decode VC-1 video that was encoded by a consumer engaged in a personal and non-commercial activity and/or was obtained from a video provider licensed to provide VC-1 video. No license is granted or shall be implied for any other use. Additional information may be obtained from MPEG LA, L.L.C. (<http://www.mpegla.com/main/default.aspx>). You acknowledge that the Software may be licensed under the AVC patent portfolio license for the personal and non-commercial use of a consumer to (a) encode video in compliance with the AVC standard ("AVC video") and/or (b) decode AVC video that was encoded by a consumer engaged in a personal and non-commercial activity and/or was obtained from a video provider licensed to provide AVC video.

ADDITIONAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO ROXIO CREATOR
This Software MAY contain certain third-party materials and technology and the use of the Software is therefore subject to the following additional notices, limitations, requirements, restrictions, disclaimers and liability limitations, as applicable:
(a) MP3 and MP3Pro Codecs. If the Software contains MP3 or MP3Pro codecs or technology, supply of the Software does not convey a license nor imply any right to distribute content created with the Software in revenue-generating broadcast systems (terrestrial, satellite, cable and/or other networks), streaming applications (via Internet, intranets, and/or other networks) other content distributions systems (pay-audio or audio-on demand applications and the like) or on physical media (compact discs, digital versatile discs, semiconductor chips, hard drives, memory cards and the like). An independent license for such use may be required. For details, please visit <http://mp3licensing.com>.
(b) Windows Media Format SDK. Content providers may be using the Microsoft digital rights management technology for Windows Media distributed with the Software ("WM-DRM") to protect the integrity of their content ("Secure Content") so that their intellectual property, including copyright, in such content is not misappropriated. Portions of the Software and other third-party applications may use WM-DRM to play Secure Content ("WM-DRM Software"). If the WM-DRM Software's security has been compromised, owners of Secure Content ("Secure Content Owners") may request that Microsoft revoke the WM-DRM Software's right to copy, display and/or play Secure Content. Revocation does not alter the WM-DRM Software's ability to play unprotected content. A list of revoked WM-DRM Software is sent to Your computer whenever You download a license for Secure Content from the Internet. Microsoft may, in conjunction with such license, also download revocation lists onto Your computer on behalf of Secure Content Owners. Secure Content Owners may also require You to upgrade some of the WM-DRM components distributed with the Software ("WM-DRM Upgrades") before accessing their content. When You attempt to play such content, WM-DRM Software built by Microsoft will notify You that a WM-DRM Upgrade is required and then ask for Your consent before the WM-DRM Upgrade is downloaded. Non-Microsoft WM-DRM Software may do the same. If You decline the upgrade, You will not be able to access content that requires the WM-DRM Upgrade; however, You will still be able to access unprotected content and Secure Content that does not require the upgrade. WM-DRM features that access the Internet, such as acquiring new licenses and/or performing a required WM-DRM Upgrade, can be switched off. When these features are switched off, You will still be able to play Secure Content if You have a valid license for such content already stored on Your computer.

(e) AVC. The Software may be licensed under the AVC patent portfolio license for the personal and non-commercial use of a consumer to (i) encode video in compliance with the AVC standard ("AVC Video") and/or (ii) decode AVC Video that was encoded by a consumer engaged in a personal and non-commercial activity and/or was obtained from a video provider licensed to provide AVC Video.

The software from Gracenote (the "Gracenote Client") enables the Software to do online disc identification and obtain music-related information, including name, artist, track, and title information ("Gracenote Data") from online servers ("Gracenote Servers") and to perform other functions. You may use Gracenote Data only by means of the intended End-User functions of the Software.
You agree that You will use Gracenote Data, the Gracenote Client, and Gracenote Servers for Your own personal non-commercial use only. You agree not to assign, copy, transfer or transmit the Gracenote Client or any Gracenote Data to any third party. YOU AGREE NOT TO USE OR EXPLOIT GRACENOTE DATA, THE GRACENOTE CLIENT, OR GRACENOTE SERVERS, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PERMITTED HEREIN.
You agree that Your non-exclusive license to use the Gracenote Data, the Gracenote Client, and Gracenote Servers will terminate if You violate these restrictions. If Your license terminates, You agree to cease any and all use of the Gracenote Data, the Gracenote Client, and Gracenote Servers. Gracenote reserves all rights in Gracenote Data, the Gracenote Client, and the Gracenote Servers, including all ownership rights. You agree that Gracenote may enforce its rights under this Agreement against You directly in its own name.
The Gracenote Service uses a unique identifier to track queries for statistical purposes. The purpose of this randomly assigned numeric identifier is to allow the Gracenote service to count queries without knowing anything about who You are. For more information, see the web page for the Gracenote Privacy Statement for the Gracenote Service.
By using the Software, You agree that the Gracenote software may submit a waveform signature to Gracenote. A waveform signature is a distillation of the sound-wave information in the music itself and helps the Gracenote service to identify artist and title information for digital music files. A waveform signature does not contain any information about You or Your computer, and computing the waveform signature should have no noticeable effect on the performance of Your computer. For more information, see the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page, and the Privacy Statement for the Gracenote Service.
The Gracenote Client and each item of Gracenote Data are licensed to You "AS IS." Gracenote makes no representations or warranties, express or implied, regarding the accuracy of any Gracenote Data from in the Gracenote Servers. Gracenote reserves the right to delete Data from the Gracenote Servers or to change Data categories for any cause that Gracenote deems sufficient. No warranty is made that the Gracenote Client or Gracenote Servers are error-free or that functioning of Gracenote Client or Gracenote Servers will be uninterrupted. Gracenote is not obligated to provide You with any new enhanced or additional Data types or categories that Gracenote may choose to provide in the future and is free to discontinue its online service at any time.
GRACENOTE DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. GRACENOTE DOES NOT WARRANT THE RESULTS THAT WILL BE OBTAINED BY YOUR USE OF THE GRACENOTE CLIENT OR ANY GRACENOTE CDDB SERVER. IN NO CASE WILL GRACENOTE BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES OR FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST REVENUES.
